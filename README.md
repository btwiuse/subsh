# subgenius

Named after the eponymous Slack-promoting parody religion, `subgenius` is the missing Polkadot.js API scripting environment that lets you have Slack while BUIDLing around Substrate.

It makes your life easier when writing scripts that interact with the polkadot-js/api

## How to use

```
$ npm install -g subgenius
```

The main executable is named `bob` instead of `subgenius`, not only because it's shorter and easier to type, but also reminiscent of the King of Slack, J. R. "Bob" Dobbs and the famous Alice and Bob.

```
$ bob
```
