Subshell at its core is a simple cli tool wrapping the following lines of code.

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env -S node --experimental-repl-await
const { ApiPromise, WsProvider } = require(`@polkadot/api`)
const provider = new WsProvider(`wss://polkadot.api.onfinality.io/public-ws`);
const types={};
api = await ApiPromise.create({ provider, types});
...
```

Thanks to esbuild and vm2, it can execute snippets written in ts/mjs/js, and load dependencies from urls like what deno does.

It's still under active development, so expect breaking changes.

There is an online version hosted at https://subshell.xyz for you to play with.
